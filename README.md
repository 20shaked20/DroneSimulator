# Drone Simulator :money_with_wings:
## Overview :pushpin:
The Drone Simulator is a Python-based simulation of an autonomous drone navigating a 2D environment. This simulator models a drone equipped with multiple sensors to detect its surroundings and autonomously plan its path to explore as much terrain as possible. The drone will return to its starting point when the battery level drops to 50%. The simulator uses Pygame for visual representation and basic control algorithms for navigation.
